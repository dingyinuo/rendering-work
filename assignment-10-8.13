// The seminal work in L-systems and plant structures, The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants by Przemys≈Çaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer, 
// was published in 1990. It is available for free in its entirety online (http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop). 
// Chapter 1 describes many sophisticated L-systems with additional drawing rules and available alphabet characters. 
// In addition, it describes several methods for generating stochastic L-systems.
